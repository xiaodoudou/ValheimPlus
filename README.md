# ValheimPlus
A HarmonyX Mod aimed at improving the gameplay quality of Valheim. The mod includes several different main features including modifiers to ingame stats of players, buildings and entities and a sophisticated system to build and place objects with high precision and a system to modify already placed objects with high precision. The general goal is to provide V+ as a base modification for your gameplay to increase quality of life, change difficulty or have a better experience in general. The mod also comes with a version and configuration control system for servers and users, allowing servers to make sure that only people with the same configuration are able to join their servers.

# Installation Instructions
We supply 4 different versions of V+ with every release since version 0.8. You can find detailed instructions on how to install these varients below.

**ATTENTION FOR MULTIPLAYER**: The game and the server both should have this mod installed to prevent all kinds of different issues. If you have the mod installed and then have friends join over steam they should have the mod as well.

## **[Game] Windows (Steam)**

1. Download the [latest package called WindowsClient.zip over this link](https://github.com/nxPublic/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
   1. Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
   2. "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
   3. Steam should open your game folder
3. Extract the contents of the archive into the game folder
4. Locate valheim_plus.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your needs
   
**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**
   
**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


## **[Server] Windows**

[Easy to setup and ready to use ValheimPlus servers can be rented here at ZAP-Hosting.com !](https://zap-hosting.com/valheimplus)

We will not explain how you create a dedicated server. This will only explain how you install the mod.

1. Download the [latest package called WindowsServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Extract the contents of the archive into your root server folder
3. Locate valheim_plus.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your needs

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


## **[Server] Unix**

[Easy to setup and ready to use ValheimPlus servers can be rented here at ZAP-Hosting.com !](https://zap-hosting.com/valheimplus)

We will not explain how you create a dedicated server. This will only explain how you install the mod.
1. Download the [latest package called UnixServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Extract the contents of the archive into your root server folder
3. *Make sure to execute 'chmod u+x start_server_bepinex.sh' to make the start script executable*
4. *Make sure that all your uploaded files belong to the owner and group, who owns and starts the Valheim server, e.g 'chown -R steam:steam ./valheim/*'*
5. Configure your server startup parameters:
    * If you intend to run the script directly, open it and edit the variables at the top (description included in the file).
    * If you want to define the parameters elsewhere, you can pass them to start_server_bepinex.sh as you would to the valheim server executable (description included in the file). This is recommended over the first approach, as updates will overwrite the start script and you would have to configure it again.
    * If you are using [LGSM](https://linuxgsm.com), go inside your instance config file and change executable to "./start_server_bepinex.sh" to load the mod and your server arguments. More on LGSM config files can be found on [their homepage](https://docs.linuxgsm.com/configuration/linuxgsm-config).
6. *Make sure to start the server via start_server_bepinex.sh or the mod will not be loaded*

**Uses libc6-dev**

**Most server hoster do not allow you to upload script files or make your own scripts executable (for very good reasons). You will have to wait until your hoster adapts V+ for his servers.**

**Please read the section about Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement) below.**


## **[Game] Unix**

1. Download the [latest package called UnixServer.zip over this link](https://github.com/valheimPlus/ValheimPlus/releases/latest/). *(Scroll down and click "assets")*
2. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
   1. Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
   2. Go to "Manage" -> "Browse local files"
   3. Steam should open your game folder
3. Extract the contents of the archive into the game folder
4. *Make sure to execute 'chmod u+x start_game_bepinex.sh' to make the start script executable*
5. Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
6. Go to "Properties..." -> "Launch options" and input "./start_game_bepinex.sh %command%"

# What if the game updates?
Game updates are unlikely to do more than partially break ValheimPlus at worst. In case you encounter any issues, use Steam's verify integrity feature- wait for it to download/update all files.
Then simply unpack the *valheim_Data* folder from the downloaded last available v+ version package into your game folder again.
This should resolve any issues related. If you continue to have issues, contact the help channel in our discord server.

# Server Config & Version Control (About Version Enforcement)
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod enabled, only people with the same configuration and mod version can join your server and you can only join servers with the same mod and configuration.
* If you have enforceConfiguration and enforceMod disabled, you can join every server including vanilla ones as long as they allow you to. 
*(Meaning they have either no v+ mod installed or enforceMod disabled)*
* If you have enforceConfiguration disabled and enforceMod enabled, you will be able to join every server with v+ installed as long as its the same version.

**This system is working 100% reliable and is issue free.**

**If you encounter problems, you have not properly set up the configuration or your server/client is not running v+**

# Join the Discord
We have several different channel including a showcase channel and alpha testing system, allowing you to always get the newest versions available to test out.

# Configuration File

The Config files name is supposed to be "valheim_plus.cfg" it needs to be placed in "BepInEx\config"

You can turn off and on every feature of V+ via the config file, by default all settings are turned off.

When you are hosting a server, your server configuration file overwrites the clients configuration file on connect. 

You only need to setup your server configuration file (located in the server files) when hosting a server with V+.

If you are hosting for your friends over steam, your friends will need v+ and they will receive your local settings from your game folder.
